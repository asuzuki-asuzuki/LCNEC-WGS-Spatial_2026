# LCNEC-WGS-Spatial_2026
In this study, we performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and spatial omics analysis of 34 lung high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (HGNECs) including large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (LCNECs) to newly conduct molecular-based case classification of LCNECs. We analyzed long- and short-read WGS data of 21 LCNEC cases. We also performed spatial transcriptome analysis Xenium and Visium for 34 HGNECs including 27 LCNEC and 7 small cell lung carcinoma cases.
